# Slide 6: **Competition: Cards + DeFi = Unbeatable**

| Feature | Autospend | Grey | Raenest | Onboard | Cenoa |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Yield** | **8-12% APY** | 0% | **0%** | 0% | 5% |
| **Cards** | **Dec 2025** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Fiat Access** | **Deep** | Deep | Deep | Basic | Basic |
| **Users** | 250 | 2M+ | 1M+ | 50K+ | 400K+ |

**Two types of competitors:**

**Fiat fintech (Grey, Raenest, Cleva)**
- Strong: Cards live, massive scale (Grey 2M, Raenest 1M, both 0% yield)
- Weak: 0% yield, fiat rails = 18-24 months to access DeFi

**Stablecoin-native (Onboard, Cenoa)**
- Strong: Cards + some yield (Cenoa 5%), established users (Cenoa 400K, Onboard 50K)
- Weak: Shallow Nigeria fiat access (no virtual naira accounts)

## **Our dual moat**

**1. DeFi Yields (LIVE NOW)**
- 8-12% APY. Grey/Raenest/Onboard: 0%. Cenoa: 5%.
- Built on $670B+ institutional protocols (Morpho, Aave, Credit Coop)
- **To replicate:** Fiat players need 18-24 month rebuild. By then we have 50K users + network effects.

**2. Cards + Deep Fiat (Dec 2025)**
- Virtual naira accounts (30-sec onboarding) + Signify cards
- PSP license (in progress)
- **To replicate:** Stablecoin players need 12-18 months. By then we're established.

**Together = unbeatable:** Only player with highest yield (8-12%) + deep fiat + cards by Dec 2025.

---

## **Honest assessment**

**We're the smallest player:**
- Grey: 2M users
- Raenest: 1M users ($11M Series A, 0% yield)
- Cenoa: 400K users (5% yield)
- Onboard: 50K users (0% yield)
- **Us: 250 users**

**Cards launch in 1 month (Dec 2025). Then we're the only one with:**
- Highest yield (8-12% vs their 0-5%)
- Deep fiat (virtual naira accounts)
- Cards for spending

**Why we still win:**
- **Yield gap:** 8-12% institutional DeFi. Cenoa: 5%. Everyone else: 0%.
- **Infrastructure moat:** Built on stablecoin rails. Raenest/Grey need 18-24 months to rebuild for DeFi.
- **Math works:** Even 0.1% of Grey's 2M = 2K users. We only need 50K for Series A.

**The brutal truth:** 
14,600x scale disadvantage. But they offer 0-5% yield. We offer 8-12%.

**The bet:** Yield differential + cards (Dec) = enough to capture 1.4% of their base.

---

## **Bottom Line**

**The reality:**
Combined, competitors have 3.65M+ users. We have 250.

**The reframe:**
- 3.65M users across 5+ countries earning 0-5% yield
- We're targeting 50K users in Nigeria earning 8-12%
- **That's 1.4% of their combined base**

**What it takes to beat us:**
- Raenest/Grey: 18-24 months to rebuild on crypto rails for real DeFi
- Cenoa: Boost from 5% to 8-12% + build Nigeria depth
- Onboard: Add Nigeria fiat depth + add any yield

**What we'll have by then:**
Cards (Dec 2025), 50K users, PSP license, Ghana/Kenya, 85% retention locking them in.

**The edge:**
We're not competing for their users. We're capturing the savers in Nigeria who want 8-12% that nobody else offers. By the time they can match us, we've already locked in 50K users with network effects.

**The honest question:** Is 8-12% yield differential enough to overcome 14,600x scale disadvantage?

**Our answer:** Yes. Because they can't offer it for 18-24 months, and we only need 1.4% of their base.
